- [DONE] Timestamps in video (resurch)
- jump to anothre video than back (make a function that does this)
    +++++++SUBTASKS++++++++
    -attribute is the new vide src
    -store old timestamp and src into a variable
    -load new video and perhaps play some effect to make it seem like loadtimes are fast
    
- dialog windows (prefferebly as a component)

*************big stuff ***********

- make a scene where at a surtain timestamp
an object appears, upon gazing at it it 
offers some options like a dialog in a game
gazing upon an option triggers the video 
to be changed and then when another event is
triggered the video has to go to the previous
timepoint it was in

    +++++++++++SUBTASKS++++++++++++++
    -choose a 360 video
    -choose event for play/pause
    -choose a timestamp at which object is shown
    -choose an object to interact with
    -design and implement it (prefferebly as component)
    -choose event to trigger actions
    -write dialog options
    -make event to trigger when an oprion is chosen
    -save timestamp of old video
    -make the videos switch upon choosing the right event
    -play until a surtain point or implement onother object
    -return to old video at saved timestamp



***************CAN WAIT OR ARE OLD******************
-[DONE] make the pin appear
- make the events trigger (mouseenter,
mouseleave, maybe gaze/fuze)
- try out component with different inputs



-think of a better way to play/pause
or fix the mobile click with cursor
- maybe make controls pannel into a
component too
